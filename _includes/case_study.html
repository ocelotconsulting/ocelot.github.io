          Ocelot was selected by a Fortune 50 client to help them with a cloud proof of concept and in the process
          implement a modern web analytics portal for a $5 billion dollar book of business.

          The client came to us with a problem, the cost of operating an on premise data warehouse is quite high and as
          they gain more business that cost will just increase. They knew the cloud could be a good solution for them,
          but they did not know how it would work for them or where to get started. This is where Ocelot came in.

            In order to meet the clients needs, Ocelot assembled a team consisting of specialists in the different
            components needed in this project. This included the following:
          </div>
          <div>
            <ul class="menu-list">
              <li>AWS networking and infrastructure</li>
              <li>Data ETL processes</li>
              <li>UI and MicroService creation</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div>
            The team got to work building the necessary components for a successfull cloud POC. 
            All the infrastructure was managed as code using AWS CloudFormation and a CI/CD pipeline was established
            using GitLab and Jenkins on AWS.
            One of the biggest challenges was implementing the 3rd party BI Solution the client used. There was an AWS Marketplace option
            availiable for the tool but it did not meet the strict security and production readiness standards required for such sensitive information.
            Instead, the team implemented their own solution to manage and host the 3rd party services needed to analyze and visualize the data for the client.

            Due to the massive success of this initial Proof of Concept, the client has gained confidence in Cloud Computing 
            and has proceeded to move forward into a full, department and company wide, cloud transformation. 
            Some of the highlights that have occured since this initial success include:
