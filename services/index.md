		<h3>With data being names the worlds most valuable resource (even surpassing oil in 2019) many companies are scrambling to understand and govern their own information assets.
		We accelerate these practices while designing and deploying data governance plans within the following offerings focused on Data Governance.
		</h3>
			<p>
				<b>Metadata:</b> the common definition is “data about data”, but in truth metadata is CONTEXT. What the data is, how it is defined, who created it, and how it should be used are some of the core portions of 
				metadata every company should have an interest in. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Ocelot offers the following engagements for <i>Metadata:</i></b>
					<li>Develop methods with business and IT for metadata creation and storage</li>
					<li>Identify resources and skill sets needed for curation and enrichment of metadata</li>
					<li>Develop plans to automate or semi-automate metadata creation and processing</li>
					<li>Drive evaluation and identification of any metadata management capabilities/tools needed</li>
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Master Data:</b> As part of any master data discipline, rules are developed for how information from sources is combined, cleaned, and reviewed. 
				The “mastered” information sources are then made available to additional applications or analytics and ensure a level of rigor and quality has been applied upstream.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Ocelot offers the following engagements for helping organizations <i>Master Data:</i></b>
					<li>Identify key domains that would benefit from mastered data within an organization</li>
					<li>Partner with IT and Business teams to develop integration and mastery plans</li>
					<li>Identify and communicate architectural steps needed to achieve data mastery</li>
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Data Quality:</b> You wouldn’t want to drink water that was only 95% clean, as without understanding what the other 5% is you might be making a horrible decision. 
				The same is true for data. The goal is not necessarily to remove or fix all the “bad” data but can also be to understand and quantify the cause or impact of the issues. 
				With this additional knowledge in hand, organizations can make an educated decision on remediating data issues or can mark certain data sets based on their quality. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Ocelot offers the following engagements for helping organizations understand and leverage <i>Data Quality</i> tracking and monitoring:</b>
					<li>Direct business and IT teams to create and automate quality metrics/solutions</li>
					<li>Define roles and responsibilities needed to effectively monitor and remediate quality issues</li>
					<li>Identify areas for process improvement and continuous improvement to boost data quality at source</li>
					<li>Define communication and education of end users for quality issues and repairs</li>

		<h3>The last several years has seen more need for personal information transparency and the ability to track information more than ever. To compliment consumer privacy requests,

		and even Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) have dramatically influenced the information technology landscape and require a new level of data security and audit capabilities.  
		</h3>
