**With data being names the worlds most valuable resource (even surpassing oil in 2019) many companies are scrambling to understand and govern their own information assets.  We accelerate these practices while designing and deploying data governance plans within the following offerings.**

 - **Metadata:** the common definition is “data about data”, but in truth metadata is CONTEXT. What the data is, how it is defined, who created it, and how it should be used are some of the core portions of metadata every company should have an interest in. Metadata is rapidly becoming a critical abstraction layer that connects data dictionaries and business glossaries across multiple storage formats and platforms (both on-premise and in the cloud). To be useful though, definitions and meanings need to be aligned, and the generation of metadata needs to be done in at least a semi-automated fashion.
 
	***Ocelot offers the following engagements for metadata:***
	- Develop methods with business and IT for metadata creation and storage.
	- Identify resources and skill sets needed for curation and enrichment of metadata
	- Develop plans to automate or semi-automate metadata creation and processing
	- Drive evaluation of current architecture and identification of any metadata management capabilities or tool selection needed.

- **Master Data:** a common practice for developing data sets that combine critical aspects from underlying source systems is to create a “master data” asset. For instance, mastered data for a customer could combine information from sales, marketing, and customer support to build a complete profile of a customer’s history with a company. As part of the master data discipline, rules are developed for how information from sources is combined, cleaned, and reviewed. The “mastered” information sources are then made available to additional applications or analytics and ensure a level of rigor and quality has been applied upstream.

	***Ocelot offers the following engagements for helping organizations master critical data:***
	 - Identify key domains that would benefit from mastered data within an organization.
	 - Partner with IT and Business teams to develop integration and mastery plans
	 - Identify and communicate potential roadblocks that could minimize value or prevent master data usage.
	 - Identify and communicate architectural steps needed to achieve data mastery.

- **Data Quality:** You wouldn’t want to drink water that was only 95% clean, as without understanding what the other 5% is you might be making a horrible decision. The same is true for data. The goal is not necessarily to remove or fix all the “bad” data but can also be to understand and quantify the cause or impact of the issues. With this additional knowledge in hand, organizations can make an educated decision on remediating data issues or can mark certain data sets based on their quality. Either way, downstream consumers of the information will benefit from an understanding of all quality issues and can ensure processes or analytics consider quality.

	***Ocelot offers the following engagements for helping organizations understand and leverage data quality tracking and monitoring:***
	- Direct business and IT teams to create and automate quality metrics/solutions
	- Define roles and responsibilities needed to effectively monitor and remediate quality issues
	- Define visualization and dashboarding of quality across data repositories
	- Identify areas for process improvement and continuous improvement to boost data quality at source
	- Define communication and education of end users for quality issues and repairs

- **Audit, Security and Compliance:** The last several years has seen more need for personal information transparency and the ability to track information more than ever. To compliment consumer privacy requests, multiple governments have created legislation that dictates how customer information must be handled and secured. Additionally, financial transactions and calculations are also seeing increased legislation due to failures in the banking industry to recognize risky investments. Sarbenes Oxley (SOX), General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and even Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) have dramatically influenced the information technology landscape and require a new level of data traceability and audit capabilities.  Traceability begins with Data lineage, or the ability to trace data from any endpoint back to its origins. Once enabled, lineage capabilities enable the ability to estimate impacts to database or application changes, produce accurate risk assessments based on data replication and movement, and ensure absolute adherence to personal data privacy requests within a GDPR mandated time frame.

	***Ocelot offers the following engagements for Audit, Security and Compliance:***
	- Develop business cases for compliance, data lineage creation,  and usage for audits
	- Identify current processes and methods for sharing current IT standards and policies
	- Define metrics and measures to ensure adherence to governance policies
	- Advise ways to construct lineage from existing platforms and applications, as well as support addition of new applications and platforms over time
	- Identify analytics that can be driven from lineage data to advise audit/compliance functions as to potential risks
	- Develop methods and automation to monitor data access and usage
