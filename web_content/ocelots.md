## Our Story

To understand what makes Ocelot different, you have to start at the beginning. Ocelot was founded in 2016 by four colleagues who worked together at a large corporation here in St. Louis. Having successfully helped that company modernize on multiple fronts - agility, modern web development, migration to public cloud, DevOps, API's and microservices - they saw an opportunity to share those experiences with other companies in the region.

This was the mission from day one - helping clients modernize by meeting them where they are, showing them what's possible, and helping them get there. Not all companies are ready to be on the leading edge. Some are moving their very first workflows from on-premise to the cloud. Some need to first invest in upgrading their security or removing dependencies on legacy platforms. Regardless of where they're at, we help them improve.

The difference is how we help them get there.

## Our Strategic Partnership Philosophy

While we are flexible, we have a preferred way of working. We collaborate with a client to define an aggressive, but achievable goal. We send 3-4 Ocelots to combine with 3-4 client employees to build as a team together. In doing this, our technical experts are training and coaching as much as they are building. We care about developing talent and developing our clients as much we care about developing software.

Why do we prefer to work in this model? The leadership team at Ocelot had decades of experience in corporate IT before moving to consulting. We've been on "the other side of the table." Ocelot was formed to be the kind of company that we always wanted to partner with.

We never wanted a partner to completely and independently own any portion of our portfolio. No matter how good their delivery, the client has to own the solution in the end. It's hard to own it if you didn't participate in building it. We never wanted a partner to go away, build a solution, and come back with a finished product. Innovation requires the agility of constant interaction, feedback, and pivoting that can only be achieved by working together, hand-in-hand.

## Developing talent, engineering success

At our core, Ocelot is engineering. The founders were all technical architects and remain hands-on in delivery with our clients. With only the leanest of overhead necessary, Ocelot is a company of technology experts specializing in cloud technologies, enterprise security, application development, and data science.

We help our clients define business and technical strategies, but it is not our model to only propose strategies. We do not seek engagements where the delivery is solely a recommendation whitepaper or slide deck. We deliver working solutions.

What makes this model work is the talent of our consultants. While we do have some of the most experienced software engineers and cloud architects in the region, we value more than just experience. We look for employees who thrive working in a team environment. They enjoy coaching and mentoring and celebrating the success of the team over individual accomplishments. They are continual learners - willing and anxious to learn new technologies and help clients realize how they can be leveraged.

It's not easy to find talent that checks all those boxes. The good news is - when you do, they are some of the best people you would ever want to work with. It makes for an amazing team and a rewarding work environment. Whether you're a senior architect or a junior engineer, nothing will accelerate your career faster than surrounding yourself with exceptionally talented colleagues who care about you.
