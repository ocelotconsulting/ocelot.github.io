## Our Story

St. Louis has become major hub for IT talent and development in the midwest, yet many organizations are struggling to adopt and use some of the newest technology innovations.  Seeing this as a 
challenge and opportunity, a small group of developers, engineers, and web design experts decided to start a company that could develop superior products and services
while attracting the top local talent.  To those ends, Ocelot has been successful, and we continue to deliver top-tier platforms, services, and analytics to further our clients'
fiscal and market differentiating goals.
